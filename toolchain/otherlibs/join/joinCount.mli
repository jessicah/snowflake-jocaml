(** Counting {i n} asynchronous events

  The following submodules are successive refinements of
  the {e count {i n} events} programming idiom.
  Here an event is a message sent on an asynchronous channel.

    - {!Down} just counts {i n} messages sent on a [tick] channel.
    - {!Collector} additionnaly computes a resut from the messages
      sent on a [collect] channel.
    - {!Dynamic} is a refinement of [Collector] where {i n} is not
      known in advance.
    - {!Monitor} is an enhancement of [Dynamic] adding the ability
      to access the list of pending computations.
*)

(** Simple countdowns. *)
module Down :
  sig
    type t = { tick : unit Join.chan; wait : unit -> unit; }

    val create : int -> t
    (** [create n] returns a countdown [c] for [n] events.
        That is, after [n] messages on [c.tick], the call
	[c.wait()] will return.
        Observe that at most one call [c.wait()] returns.*)
  end


(** Collecting countdowns, or {e collectors}. *)
module Collector :
  sig
    type ('a, 'b) t = { collect : 'a Join.chan; wait : unit -> 'b; }
    (** Type of collectors.

     Collectors are refinements of countdowns, which collect and
     combine [n] partial results (type ['a]) into a final result
     (type ['b]). Given a collector [c] for [n] events, with
     combining function [comb] and initial result [y0]:
       - The [n] events, [x1],...,[xn], are sent as [n] messages
         on [c.collect]. Notice that the notation [xi] does
         not imply any kind of ordering.
       - Then [c.wait()] returns the
          value [comb x1 (comb x2 (... (comb xn y0)))].
          Again, at most one call  [c.wait()] returns.
    *)

    val create : ('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'b -> int -> ('a, 'b) t
    (** [create comb y0 n] returns a collector of [n]
	events of type ['a],  with combining function [comb] and initial
        result [y0]. *)

(** Dynamic collectors *)
module Dynamic :

      enter : unit -> unit;
      leave : 'a Join.chan;
      wait : unit -> 'b;
      finished : unit Join.chan;
    }
   (** Dynamic collectors are refinement of simple collectors,
       for which the number of events to collect need not be given in
       advance.

      Given a dynamic collector [c], defined as [create comb y0]:
        - [c] is informed of the future occurence of an event [xi],
          by sending an unit message on [c.enter()].
        - [c] is informed of the occurence of event [xi] by sending
          a message [c.leave(xi)].
        - [c] is informed that no more event will occur by sending
          a message [c.finished()].

     Then the call [c.wait()] will return the combined result
          [comb x1 (comb x2 (... (comb xn y0)))], once all the announced
          events have occurred. Observe that at most one such call is allowed.
    *)

    val create : ('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'b -> ('a, 'b) t

    (** Monitiors are enhancements of dynamic collectors adding the
        ability to access the list of pending computations.

        Given a monitor [m], defined as [create comb y0]:
          - [m] is informed of the start of a computation by sending
            a message [m.enter xi] where [xi] is the input of the
            computation, an identifier for the computation being returned.
          - [m] is informed of the end of a computation by sending
            a message [m.leave (id, yi)] where [id] is the computation
            identifier as previously returned by [enter], and [yi] is
            the result of the computation.
          - [m.is_pending id] returns whether the computation whose
            identifier is passed is pending (a computation is pending
            if it has been "entered" but not yet "leaved").
          - [m.get_pendings ()] returns the list of pending computations.
          - [m] is informed that no more computation will be entered
            by sending a message [m.finished ()].

        The call [m.wait ()] will return the combined result
        [comb y1 (comb y2 (... (comb yn y0)))], once all the announced
        events have occurred. Observe that at most one such call is allowed. *)

    val create : ('b -> 'c -> 'c) -> 'c -> ('a, 'b, 'c) t

        result [y0]. *)
