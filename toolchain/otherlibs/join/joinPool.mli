(** Advanced implementation with functorial interface *)
module Shared : sig

(** This module provides advanced task management.
    Pools dispatch computations among registered agents, re-issuing pending
    tasks if agents do not send computation outcomes.
    It improves over the more simple {!Simple} in the following aspects:
    - The same pool can be shared by several computations.
    - More efficient handling of task re-issuing: fresh tasks have priority
      over re-issued tasks.
    - Ability to abort duplicated tasks when outcome reaches the pool.
    - A little control on pool behavior is offered by the means
      of the {!Config} module
      argument.
*)

(** If true, gives a few diagnostics on the standard error stream. *)
  val nagain : int
(** A given task will be re-issued at most [nagain] times.
    No limit is enforced when [nagain] is strictly less that zero *)
end

(** Functional enumerations *)
module type Enumerable = sig


(** Signature of iterators: modules that
    offer a functional iterator over collections (type [t])
    of elements (type [elt]) in a functional way *)

  type t     (** Collection *)
  type elt   (** Elements in the collection *)
  type enum  (** Explicit state. *)


  val start : t -> enum
  (** Start iterating over a collection, [start c]
      returns the initial state *)

  val step : enum -> (elt * enum) option
  (** Iterate once, [step st] returns [None] when iteration is over,
      or [Some (e,st')] otherwise, where [e] is the next element and
      [st']  is the next explicit state. *)

(** An example: iterator over integer intervals:

{[module Interval = struct
  type t = { low : int; high : int; } (* Interval (low..high) *)
  type elt = int
  type enum = { next : int; max : int; }

  let start x = { next=x.low; max=x.high; }

  let step x =
    if x.next > x.max then None
    else Some (x.next, { x with next=x.next+1; })
end]}
*)

(** Another example: iterator over a list:

{[module  ListMake(E:sig type elt end) = struct
  type t = E.elt list
  type elt = E.elt
  type enum = t

  let start xs = xs

  let step = function
  | [] -> None
  | x::xs -> Some (x,xs)

end]}

  type ('elt,'partial) interruptible_worker =

  type kill = subtask_id Join.chan (** To abort given subtask *)


(** Output signature of the pool functor *)

    }
(** Pools dispatch computations among registered agents, re-issuing pending
    tasks if agents do not send computation outcomes.

    Given a pool [p], returned by [create ()]:
    - [p.register w] is used by agents to indicate that they can perform
      computations, mapping [xi] values to [yi] results, using the
      synchronous channel [w].
    - [p.fold  c comb y0] returns the combined result
      [comb y1 (comb y2 (... (comb yn y0)))],
      where the [yi] values are the results of the [xi]
      transformed by the functions
      registered by the agents. The [xi] result from enumerating the collection
      [c]. The enumeration technique is specified by the module argument [E]
      (signature {!Enumerable})
      to the functor {!Make}.
    - [p.register_interruptible (w,k)] is used by agents to indicate that
      they can perform computations as above.
      Additionally the pool logics will attempt to abort computations
      found to be useless by issusing messages on channel [k].
      More specifically, when
      given an argument [(id,xi)] by the pool logics,
      the synchronous channel [w] should return [Some yi],
      where [xi] and [yi] are the same as in the description of [p.fold] above.
      However, if the pool sends [id] on channel [k] before [yi] is
      available, then the agent may abort the computation of [yi],
      so as to spare computing power.
      In that case, [w(xi)] must reply [None].
      It is the agent responsability to check that subtask identifiers
      sent on the [w] and [k] channels
      are equal before aborting the subtask and having [w] to reply [None] *)
