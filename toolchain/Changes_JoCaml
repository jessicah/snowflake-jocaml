JoCaml 3.12.1
-------------

JoCaml 3.12.0

  that patterns are type-correct.

  closing in critical section.
 
- Added new librairy JoinCom [producer/consumers, previously in JoinFifo]

- Added new librairies JoinHelper, JoinPool and JoinProc (replacement
  for Unix fork/exec helpers, which are not thread safe at all)

  (bug #1, rev 10200)
